## Kaam -Dhanda
Simplistic Web Portal designed to create jobs for the workers and the lower class employess who are not well read and have limited resources (i.e no access to internet and no smart phones)
There is only one login with phone number which is otp based so need to remember passwords
Once registered worker will get regular updates via SMS ( if registered as active worker ).
Activity and other Job fetching controls are controlled with help of USSD no.


The employers are required to login every time they post the jobs and others updates will be SMS based also
Posting job is fairly simple.
Search jobs option is there so u can get the contact no of the workers directly as well 
Employers acn verify the workers using otp
